# Welcome to Dotless!

**We're building an Arabic keyboard like no other, blending an ancient script with modern tech.**<br><br><br>

## What's it all about?

Well, the Arabic alphabet as we know it, although familiar, is not the original. The ancient Arabs had no need for diacritic marks or dots to decipher the meanings of words, but later generations did…

*...until now.* The Dotless Arabic keyboard leverages machine learning technology to accurately predict words based on their context, eliminating 12 keys from the standard Arabic keyboard to provide a simpler and easier typing experience.<br><br><br>

## Demo

<video width="500px" 
       height="1000px"
       controls autoplay muted loop>
    <source src="working_demo3.mp4"
            type="video/mp4" />
    There was an error displaying this video.

## Our Goal

Dotless is a vision for a mobile keyboard app for the Arabic script which reduces the number of keys by using machine learning to differentiate between similar letters (e.g. ج،ح،خ) based on context, thereby drastically simplifying the layout and making it easier for users to type.

We accomplish this by using a statistical n-gram model trained on a large corpus of Arabic sentences to make predictions. Currently, the Android app is in the alpha stage of testing, but we hope to have it on Google Play soon so that you can try it out for yourself!

We are also planning to develop a similar app for iOS devices, as well as extending support for other languages written in the Arabic script such as Farsi, Urdu, Kurdish, Uyghur, and many others, In Shaa Allah!
